MVP: Add link to API Search Bar Returns single, or list of Jokes relevant to searched word Looks decent enough (laugh with, not at)

PMVP: Cross reference? 2 inputs for Intersectional jokes (Fat + Dentist, Mother in Law + Mean)

Goals: Create a cleaner API search function than the Weather app. Make it look nicer too. Focus on time-management in seeing realistically how long it takes to get set up, get working, and then styling. End goal is to feel more comfortable creating and submitting this than with the Weather lab, which was my 1st (not counting the in-class Star Wars pulls) time working with an API

Days Prior - Have API picked out, beginning to code Get function M - have basic framework in development T initial model W mvp working Th post mvp F: present
