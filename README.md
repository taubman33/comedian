# Project Overview

## Project Name

 Everyone’s a comedian

## Project Description

Searching Joke API’s by keyword to find new jokes, a quick way to make anybody funnier!

## API and Data Sample

https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api
Data sampling coming soon

## Wireframes

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Add link to API
- Search Bar Returns single, or list of Jokes relevant to searched word 
- Looks decent enough (laugh with, not at)

#### PostMVP 

- Cross reference? 2 inputs for Intersectional jokes (Fat + Dentist, Mother in Law + Mean)
- because the API part of this site will be simple enough, I'd like the styling to be better than what I've been doing before

Now that the API has been found, I imagine it will go somewhat like this:

- Getting Try/Get/Axios functions all working - 2 / 3 hrs
- Getting API info to load properly onto the site - 2 / 3 hrs
- Getting the aformentioned codes to work in my site - 3 / 4 hrs
- Styling - Realistically probably ~ 5 hrs. Especially b/c the API can only be called 5x/hr

## API Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |


## Code Snippet
